# 3.0 Design Process

#### 3.1 Background Research

Alzheimer's disease is a physical brain disease that causes dementia, leading to impaired memory, thinking and behavior. (Dementia Australia, 2019). According to the Alzheimer's Association (2019), the proportion of Alzheimer's disease in dementia is as high as 60 percent to 80 With the increase of age, many elderly people's disease will gradually deteriorate. Worldwide, at least 44 million people have dementia, and 342, 000 Australians are living with this disease (Alzheimer's Association, 2019). The number of diseases is increasing every year, which also lead to burdens to many families.
