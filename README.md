# 3.0 Design Process & Project summary
### Project Summary

Alzheimer’s disease is one of the most common brain diseases worldwide, it affects memory, cognitive ability, and daily activities and performance. For our project domain, we decided is the intervention of Alzheimer’s disease. From our background research, we found that if the intervention is early having a positive effect on the symptoms. In our project, we chose to use some memory exercises to improve the cognitive of people with Alzheimer’s disease.

We have developed an application that will support memory exercise for people with Alzheimer’ disease, the application we consider allows users to more easily to do the exercise based on their life experiences.

In the design process, we conducted background research with the literature, and conducted two rounds of interviews since we could not directly access the target users, we chose to interview their families. In order to improve our prototype, we did the user test, and the users were mainly their family members or people with certain knowledge of the disease. We have four iterations of digital prototype and a website as a based functionality prototype.

Project reflection
The obstacle in our design process is that we cannot directly access our target users, and hard to do the user testing. In our iteration, we attempt to find the relevant people to obtained feedback, but there is uncertainly for the research we are doing represents our target audience, thus we attempt to make design and solution get closure to the target users. Even though the tester (patient's family members) we selected were thinking from the perspective of the patients, they were still partial, because they had not experienced the experience personally, so they could not fully understand the experience. Even if it makes more assumptions, it is still a spectator's perspective. To this end, we used several reliable research findings to make up for this missing piece, hoping to make the application appropriate for patients.
